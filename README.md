# Project Documentation Guidelines

## Introduction
Welcome to our project! In our collaborative environment, it's crucial that we maintain clear and concise documentation for every piece of code that we add. This practice not only helps in keeping track of changes but also ensures that every team member understands the purpose and functionality of each addition.

## Contribution Guidelines
When contributing to this repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### Documentation of Code
For every code contribution, please include detailed comments or documentation that explains:
- **How the code works**: Describe the functionality of the code. Include any technical details that are necessary for understanding its operation.
- **Purpose of the code**: Clearly state the reason for adding this code. Explain what problem it solves or what feature it adds to the project.

This information should be included as in-line comments within the code or as a part of the pull request description.

### Pull Requests
Ensure that your pull requests are:
- **Descriptive**: The title and description of the pull request should clearly state what the changes are and why they are necessary.
- **Focused**: Each pull request should encompass a single feature or fix. Avoid combining multiple changes in one request.

### Review Process
- All pull requests require at least three approving reviews before they can be merged into the main branch.
- Feedback from reviewers should be addressed promptly and thoroughly.

## Conclusion
Your adherence to these guidelines ensures a smooth and efficient workflow for the entire team. Together, we can maintain a high standard of code quality and make our project a success.

Thank you for your contributions and cooperation!
